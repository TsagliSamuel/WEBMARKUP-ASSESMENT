                The Red light district is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country. Every year, the
                district attracts about 10 million tourists and this is because of the

                of profits from tourism alone.

            Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art based on grappling and ground fighting,
            focusing on the skill of controlling one’s opponent through techniques that force him
            or her to submit. It prides itself in being known as the “gentle art”, allowing a smaller,
            weaker person to use leverage and submissions (chokes, locks) to defend himself against
            a bigger opponent.
